This app uses Expo & React Native. 
In order to do Optical Character Recognition, I will be using Tesseract.js. However, currently Tesseract.js does not work on Expo.  Therefore the project on pause for now. 
The next step will be to eject from expo so that it can use Tesseract.js for the optical character recognition (OCR).
